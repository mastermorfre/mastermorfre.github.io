	<p>**HIGH COMPLEXITY ASIN TRACKER** (Action Items by bucket): <https://drive.corp.amazon.com/documents/frear%40/HRE_INELIGIBLE_W47.csv>. We’ve added Units Sold, GMS and Profits / Loss - MX historical 2015-today - for you to filter by your GL and easily define prioritization for ASINs in the High Risk Action Item buckets.
	</p>


	<p>**Fully Classified ASINs refers to ASINs that have been classified both for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule [Mexico HTS & USA HTS] and Amazon’s Regulatory Intelligence Classification. GTS Ready refers to ASINs fully classified and that are compliant with other regulatory requirements – high risk ASINs -, if applicable.**
	</p>


	<p>- The MX GTS has a classification WoW progress of ~5.3K ASINs from W48 to W49. YTD, ~675.2K ASINs have been fully classified for the MX NAFN program, out of which ~417.7K ASINs are enrolled as of W48. The GAP of ~257.4K ASINs not enrolled is broken down as follows: ~155K ASINs are INELIGIBLE in the US Buyable weekly list for NAFN; 113.4K ASINs are INELIGIBLE for either failing a CROP rule or other NAFN consideration and ~41.6K are High Risk ASINs, the remaining ~102.4K ASINs are either unsupported in MX or have been deprioritized due to a business decision. 
	</p>

	<p>**As of W47, the High Risk Enablement Breakdown is as follows: the total HRE INELIGIBLE accounted for ~53.3K ASINs, including ~15K unsupported / non-importable ASINs and ~41.8K actionable and supported ASINs that remain INELIGIBLE in CROP in the NAFN US Buyable weekly list. The actionable ASINs are includes ~10.1K VM Actionable for Commercial Information Requirements / Manuals (WoW, this bucket has only reduces in 700 ASINs), ~13.1K ASINs VM Actionable for Lab Testing Requirements (samples, product technical information, wiring diagrams, etc), ~2.2K VM Actionable for Free Sale Letter, ~1.4K DIPC Actionable ASINs.**
	</p>

	<p>The MX GTS team has set up a shared folder for us to receive required vendor documentation seamlessly in order to accelerate the import compliance process for high risk ASINs. The main premise is; VMs have a shared folder in their C: drives where they are to drag and drop required docs for High Complexity ASINs in their respective category folder (just like Dropbox). Please check out the Doc Submission Guidelines (<https://drive.corp.amazon.com/documents/frear%40/MX%20GTS%20WorkDocs%20-%20Doc%20Submission.docx>) follow this to gain access, install the shared folder in your drive and comply with our naming convention.
